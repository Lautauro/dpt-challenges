# My journey to learn the C language
My name is Lautaro and I'm learning to program. In this case, I'll be using the C language.

## Why C?
Because I think it could give me a great understanding of how a computer works. In the past I have used Javascript, so this is a challenge for me.

## How are you learning it?
I'm reading ["The C programming language (K&R)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).
